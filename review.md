## Assingment Data Science 1: Peer Review
### Github repository: [Link](https://github.com/balintdecsi/ceu-ds-1-mini-project)


#### 1. Reproducibility report: 

- I was able to run the analysis by modyifing only one line of code! And it worked as expected. 

- It is possible to run it without modifying the lines of code since the paths have been standarized, but due to by own personal preference, I decided to change it. 

- In terms of reproducibility, it works perfectly. 

#### 2. Overall opinion:

The documentation is clean, it is explained and mentioned how this code should be ran, the data sources, and the results. The sections of the repository are the expected, as mentioned during class, where everything is included with a proper organization. The coding style is on my opinion is adequate, since each line of code is explained and no assumptios are made. The use of git is the correct, as the commits in the repository follow a clean order and the comment explains the performed or the changes applied. Overall, this a complete and excellent code/analysis and github repository. 

#### 3. Suggested improvements: 

- I would include the derived data in the reports/figures section. 
- In this same note, maybe change the folder name to "results" and include the plot and the csv file with the results of the analysis. 

Overall, an excellent github repository!
